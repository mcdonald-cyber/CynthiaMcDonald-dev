## Personal Webpage

This is a my first portfolio item I've produced under the guidiance of my course with [Thinkful](thinkful.com). It is a personal website introducing myself as a web developer.
It shows some basic HTML and CSS skills. I also took care to show case my creative design aesthetics. 

## Creator
I'm a web developer working on developing my coding skills. I live in Los Angeles and love the city's connection to the World Wide Web community. 

## Acknowledgemet

Several of the example sites from my [Thinkful](thinkful.com) courses helped inspire the design of this site.
I'd like to thank [colormind](http://colormind.io/) for helping me figure out my color palette and element designs.
